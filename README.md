## concept
<p>This is a conceptual project for the future. I want to learn all of the ins and outs of Github by playing with this sample rewrite of the Lightbox Application. When I am done, I will know how to create repositories, branch, merge, create pull requests, do commits, reviews.</p>
<p>Also want to play with different project setups for AngularJS.</p>
