# concept
<p>This is a conceptual project for the future.  want to learn all of the ins and outs of Github by playing with this demo/sample project. If this is successful, I will know how to create repositories, branch, merge, create pull requests, and do commits.</p>
<p>Also want to play with different project setups for AngularJS.</p>
